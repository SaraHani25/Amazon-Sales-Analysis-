## ⚙️ Data Processing & Analysis Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded Amazon sales dataset using **pandas (`pd.read_csv()`)**.  
- Verified successful import with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.shape()`.

### 2️⃣ Initial Data Exploration
- Reviewed dataset dimensions, column names, and basic statistics using `.describe()`.  
- Identified key metrics like product category, price, and rating.

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled **missing values** and **duplicates**.  
- Fixed **data types** (e.g., converted text to numeric where applicable).  
- Standardized and renamed columns for readability.

### 4️⃣ Feature Understanding
- Analyzed relationships between **price**, **rating**, and **product category**.  
- Engineered new metrics such as **discount percentage** and **review sentiment indicators**.

### 5️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used **groupby** and **aggregation** to summarize sales and ratings per category.  
- Visualized key trends using:
  - 📊 **Histograms** – price and rating distributions  
  - 📈 **Bar charts** – top-performing product categories  
  - 📦 **Boxplots** – price variations and outliers  
  - 🔵 **Scatter plots** – price vs. rating correlation

### 6️⃣ Data Visualization
- Built insightful visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Customized chart aesthetics with:
  - Color themes  
  - Clear titles and labels  
  - Legends and annotations  
- Exported key charts as `.png` files for dashboards and presentations.

### 7️⃣ Insights & Conclusions
- Identified **categories with high ratings and competitive prices**.  
- Found **price thresholds** where customer satisfaction drops.  
- Highlighted opportunities for **pricing optimization** and **inventory strategy**.
